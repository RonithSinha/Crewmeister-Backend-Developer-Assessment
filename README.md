# Backend Developer Assessment ðŸš€

Here is my submission for the Java Backend Developer Assessment for Crewmeister.

### API Documentation

This project uses **Swagger UI** to provide interactive documentation for the RESTful APIs.

Once the application is running, you can access Swagger UI at: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

I have also attached the postman collection for the APIs in this repository - **Foreign exchange service.postman_collection.json**

### Testing

This project includes 3 test classes to ensure functionality across different layers of the application:

1. **Controller Unit Test** â€“ Validates the behavior of the application's REST endpoints, ensuring correct request handling and response generation.
2. **Service Unit Test** â€“ Focuses on testing the business logic within the service layer, ensuring correct processing and data manipulation.
3. **Integration Test** â€“ Ensures the interaction between different components of the application works as expected, including database and API communication.

Each test class plays a crucial role in maintaining code reliability and stability across different layers of the application.

Hope you have a good time reviewing the project. Please let me know in case you have any questions ðŸ˜Š
